<h2>Abstract<h2/><br>
Existing dysrhythmia classification systems suffer from limited accuracy and adoption by healthcare professionals. This issue encouraged many researchers to adopt machine learning and deep learning models, but these systems donâ€™t demonstrate clear dominance of machine learning and deep learning models. Hence the proposed modified convolution neural network model.
